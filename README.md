#I have used predefined API and packages for crawling Facebook pages(Source:https://pypi.org/) 
#Crawling Facebook data : Public Posts using groupName

1. Pass a groupName as an input parameter for which the public posts needs to be retrived 
2. Depending upon the project requirements, one can choose either some or all of the following in the code.
post_id, text, post_text,shared_text, image,likes,comments,shares,post_url, link.
In this repository, I am going to retrive all of the fields tagged to a particular post.
3. Post retrival, I am writing it into a csv after parsing the data into required format.


Happy Coding, 
Sindhu.
